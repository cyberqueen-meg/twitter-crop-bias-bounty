# Twitter Algorithmic Bias HackerOne Bug Bounty Submissions
## Welcome! Please check out the folders containing each individual bounty I submitted for the contest relating to AI bias in Twitter's cropping algorithm.

### This contest was hosted through HackerOne and challenged participants to find examples of flawed AI in the saliency of Twitter's cropping algorithm. I submitted 2 examples: one for economic harm and one for underrepresentation of living beings with darker skin.
