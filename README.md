# Twitter Algorithmic Bias HackerOne Bug Bounty Submissions
## Welcome! Please check out the folders containing each individual bounty I submitted for the contest relating to AI bias in Twitter's cropping algorithm.

### This contest was hosted through HackerOne and challenged participants to find examples of flawed AI in the saliency of Twitter's cropping algorithm. I submitted 3 examples: one for economic harm, one that shows that the saliency algorithm focuses on lighter skinned canines over darker skinned canines, and one that shows that the saliency algorithm favors a lighter colored canine over a darker skinned human.
